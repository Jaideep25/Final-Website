            <p> My name is Jaideep, I like to code, play videogames, and my most favorite like to swim. I have made a few games for you to play; check them out in my projects. I am currently in 9th grade and I go to Sudarshan Vidya Mandir School (in short SVM). I might make a youtube channel and upload my games and apps on playstore in the near future, and I will post the link here.</p>
