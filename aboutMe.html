            <p> My name is Anik Dey, and besides programming, I play the violin, I like to draw, and I perform in martial arts(karate). I have made a few games for you to play; check them out in my projects. I am currently in 8th grade and I go to Piney Grove Middle School. I might make a youtube channel in the near future, and I will post the link here.</p>
